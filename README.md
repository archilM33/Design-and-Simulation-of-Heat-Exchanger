# Design-and-Simulation-of-Heat-Exchanger
I designed and developed a complex Shell and Tube Heat Exchanger, incorporating 412 tubes across 4 distinct sections to maximize thermal performance. By carefully selecting materials and optimizing both volume and surface area geometry, I achieved a 30% improvement in thermal efficiency. Throughout the process, I gained extensive hands-on experience with Ansys software, using its advanced capabilities to simulate flow dynamics within the exchanger. To further boost performance by 15%, I implemented a counterflow configuration and integrated 7+ baffles to enhance internal fluid mixing. I managed the entire workflow—from conceptual design in Fusion 360 to simulation and analysis using Ansys Meshing, Fluent, and CFD-Post—ensuring a robust and technically sound solution through each stage.
